# mosh-client-rs

An independent, unofficial, wire-compatible Mosh client implementation in Rust.

## Status

The current GitHub Release, [0.1.4](https://github.com/wandcs/mosh-client-rs/releases/tag/v0.1.4),
is available on GitHub. The Cargo package is named `mosh-client`
and requires Rust 1.88 or newer. Its initial scope is stock `mosh-server`
1.4.0, IPv4, one fixed UDP server endpoint, and the UTF-8 `xterm-256color`
profile. See the [0.1.4 release review](docs/releases/0.1.4.md) for verification
and publication status and the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the release scope.

Use the release tag as a Git dependency; this version has not been uploaded to
crates.io:

```toml
[dependencies]
mosh-client = { git = "https://github.com/wandcs/mosh-client-rs", tag = "v0.1.4", version = "=0.1.4" }
```

Phase 1's bounded authenticated UDP core and Phase 2 are complete. Phase 3 now
exports the first small Session API with explicit lifecycle state, distinct
graceful close and prompt cancellation, bounded commands, and ordered VT
output. A separate latest-value reachability contract reports missing recent
contact or reply without treating network silence as close. Phase 2
includes SSP synchronization, timing and recovery scheduling, bounded fragment
reassembly, authoritative terminal state, VT painting, and a Session
driver with bounded confirmed-epoch ASCII prediction whose HostBytes and echo
acknowledgement reconciliation is independent of difference batching. A local
stock `mosh-server` 1.4.0 fixture completed an interactive shell exchange from
bootstrap through prompt, input, output, full repaint, and cancellation.
Additional loopback fixtures cover tmux attach, two-window
navigation, detach and reattach, a Vim full-screen edit and repaint, 128 ordered
input commands, 1,200 lines of output under display backpressure, and recovery
after a 1.5-second bidirectional outage plus an authenticated UDP source-port
change. A separate fixture proves that server disappearance leaves the Session
locally repaintable and cancellable. A stock resize fixture verifies remote PTY
changes from 80×24 to 100×30 and 60×20. A controlled-delay comparison records
non-predictive medians of 108 ms and 189 ms at 80 ms and 160 ms imposed RTT,
while the confirmed prediction epoch removes that visible network delay and
still converges to a stock-server marker.

Established Sessions retain their protocol and terminal state across a narrow
allowlist of local UDP interface, route, address, and physically observed
permission failures. Failed sends stay uncommitted, and receive failures pause
polling; both retry at a bounded cadence on the same socket. Initial connection
errors and other I/O categories remain explicit failures.

The Phase 2 viability gate found no material terminal-correctness or recovery
deficit within the declared local compatibility scope. Public contract tests
cover validation, owner shutdown, state, graceful close, and idempotent
cancellation; stock 1.4.0 fixtures drive the same public API and verify both
authenticated close directions. LeanTTY has also integrated
the crate behind an independent native Mosh owner and linked it in an ARM64 OHOS
release build without adding a generic Transport layer. Its development
fixtures also demonstrate public prediction, authenticated close, WLAN
interruption recovery, and a real source-address change on one physical ARM64
HarmonyOS PC. These consumer results do not certify LeanTTY's separate 1.6
release or extend support to other devices and network configurations.

See [the roadmap](docs/roadmap.md), the
[LeanTTY integration review](docs/leantty-integration-entry-review.md), and the
[security and publication review](docs/security-publication-review.md).

## Library shape

`Session::connect` returns a caller-owned `Session` handle and a `SessionTask`.
The caller runs the task on its own Tokio executor, sends input or resize
commands through the handle, consumes ordered VT chunks, and explicitly closes,
cancels, or drops the Session. Reachability remains independent from lifecycle
and output backpressure. Prediction display defaults to `Adaptive`; callers can
select `Adaptive`, `Always`, or `Never` per Session with
`Session::connect_with_prediction_mode`. See
[ADR 0007](docs/decisions/0007-public-session-api.md) for lifecycle and
backpressure semantics and
[ADR 0008](docs/decisions/0008-authenticated-graceful-close.md) for the
authenticated close exchange, and
[ADR 0009](docs/decisions/0009-session-reachability.md) for reachability and
initial attachment timeout, and
[ADR 0010](docs/decisions/0010-public-prediction-modes.md) for the bounded
prediction-mode contract.

`Session::next_output` reconstructs the stock server's current visible screen;
it is not a raw remote PTY stream. It does not report when a remote application
enters or leaves an alternate screen, and it does not provide complete local
scrollback. An embedding application that must restore its pre-Mosh terminal
state should isolate the whole Session in a temporary terminal page.

## Goal

Build a memory-safe Mosh client core that interoperates with the stock
`mosh-server` and can support ARM64 HarmonyOS applications such as LeanTTY.
The library owns Mosh protocol state and UDP recovery. Its caller owns SSH
authentication, host verification, server startup, and terminal presentation.

## Initial contract

- Client only; no `mosh-server` implementation.
- Rust library first; no general-purpose CLI in the initial scope.
- Initial compatibility target: stock `mosh-server` 1.4.0.
- Initial network scope: IPv4 and a fixed UDP port.
- One crate until real ownership or build boundaries justify a split.
- No plugin framework or generic transport abstraction.
- No server installation, file transfer, port forwarding, or session manager.

The [project principles](docs/project-principles.md) govern scope, architecture,
dependencies, public API, testing, and LeanTTY integration. See also

## Independent implementation

This project does not copy GPL-covered Mosh source code, comments, file
organization, or tests. Protocol behavior must come from public specifications,
papers, standards, documented black-box observations, or original analysis.
Every nontrivial compatibility rule must record its source in
[the provenance log](docs/provenance.md).

Third-party implementations, including MoshCatty, `dart_mosh`, and `mosh-go`,
may inform architecture hypotheses and tradeoffs. Project code and tests remain
independently written, and third-party implementations do not replace
independent wire evidence or stock-server interoperability verification.

The project uses established, permissively licensed cryptographic primitives.
It does not implement cryptographic algorithms from scratch.

## Development

Run Rust work in the default WSL distribution from
`/mnt/c/repos/mosh-client-rs`:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets --all-features
```

Release verification also runs the same checks and rustdoc with Rust 1.88.0,
the declared minimum version. See [testing](docs/testing.md) for the stock,
fuzz, dependency, and ARM64 checks.
